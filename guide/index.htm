						<p class="content">The intent of this page is to highlight insights that we learned over the course of a semester researching the school and its constituencies, as well as document the various interaction and visual standards that we established and our thought processes behind them.</p>

						<h2 class="inside">Key Insights</h2>
						<ul id="takeaways">
							<li class="alpha grid_3">
								<h4>Importance of Information</h4>
								<p>The website is the main source of information about the school and should be treated as a priority.</p>
								<p>Information should be shown in the format that it wants to be in. Information should be considered and carefully designed.</p>
								<p>The web is capable of good typography and hierarchy and should reflect the aesthetic values of the school.</p>
							</li>
							
							<li class="grid_3">
								<h4>Process Culture</h4>
								<p>The importance of process and documentation should be indoctrinated in the students. We present stories, not slideshows.</p>
								<p>Students should be encouraged to think about how to talk about their work. Next steps could include how to enable conversation and even critique.</p>
								<p>The new gallery structure isn't creating more work, it's a natural step forward from physical process books. It's more environmental and accessible for everyone.</p>
							</li>
							
							<li class="grid_3 omega">
								<h4>Involving the Community</h4>
								<p>All parties we've spoken to agree that there is not enough transparency and overlap between different groups within the school.</p>
								<p>Students generating content for the Exhibition alleviates work from professors, and gives students a voice in how their work is depicted.</p>
								<p>Given an outlet, students will create high-quality content that drives internal, and consequently external, culture.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>

					<section class="prefix_3 grid_9" id="brandnotes">
						<h2 class="inside">Brand notes</h2>
						<div class="alpha grid_6">
							<p class="content">The current expression CMU Design's brand is misaligned with what we experience as members of the school. Students, faculty, and visitors know we have an incredible program that approaches its goals with sincerity and is blessed with a wealth of talent. Prospectives and outsiders see a dated institution with a shallow sense of community despite its fantastic alum. We think the website is an opportunity to foster a vibrant community.<p>
							<p class="content">Imagine going to the CMU Design website, and seing featured "op-ed" content from its community: an illustrated guide to design school by a worldy senior, a video made by students documenting a camping excursion, a guide to upcoming PGH concerts and events&mdash;all written by students and vetted by faculty. There's no substitute for community when building a strong brand, and the results will speak for themselves&mdash;in demand from prospectives, faculty searches, and alumni donations.</p>
							<p class="content">RISD already has a <a href="http://all-nighter.com" class="orange">student run publication</a>, and <a href="http://aiga.cmustudents.org">we've shown initiative</a> too. Imagine if students knew they had a voice on the website and could get more eyeballs on their content. To capture this sense of community to strengthen our brand, all we have to do is put it on the front page of our website.</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					
					<section class="prefix_3 grid_9" id="functionality">
						<h2 class="inside">Exhibition and Intranet</h2>
						<img src="../assets/img/guide/gallery-diagram.png">
						<div class="alpha grid_6">
							<p>The <a href="../exhibition" class="orange">Exhibition</a> is our implementation of a Gallery. It is based around classes and projects, with every student's work online. All students are required in the curriculum to document their work digitally on the intranet, and then faculty and staff revise submissions before any work goes live.</p>
							<p>The public sees work from the past semester, allowing maintenance of the Exhibition to be completed anytime before the semester deadline. Internally, members of the School would be able to view the entire archive of work via the internet.</p>
							<p>The Exhibition also provides opportunities for students to have their work highlighted. Highlighted work appears in the heroes and sidekicks of exhibition pages. The front page of the Exhibition features one or a few exemplary projects. Class-level pages house one piece of work that represents the goals of that class, and likewise for project-level pages.</p><br>
							<p>The <a href="../intranet" class="orange">Intranet</a> is designed to be nondisruptive with people's current habits and straightforward to implement and adopt. The Presto printing service (<a href="http://pit.design.cmu.edu" class="orange">pit.design.cmu.edu</a>) is folded into the Intranet, with the potential to house future services. Students can manage their projects and online profile, while teachers can collect their students' project documentation.</p>

							<img alt="Header" class="alpha grid_3" src="../assets/img/guide/wf-header.png">
							<div class="grid_6 omega">
								<h4>Header</h4>
								<p>The <em>header</em> is a full width orange-red bar. It is slightly overlapped by the hero or sidekick image. On the left end, contained within the grid, is the school's logo. Flush to the right edge is the top-level navigation.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						
						<div>
							<img alt="Hero and Sidekick" class="alpha grid_3" src="../assets/img/guide/wf-hero.png">
							<div class="grid_6 omega">
								<h4>Heroes and Sidekicks</h4>
								<p>Below the logo and navigation is a large panoramic image, the taller of which are <em>heroes</em> and the shorter of which are <em>sidekicks</em>.</p>
								<p>Heroes are visible only on the homepage and the top-level Exhibition page, and are for critically important announcements (such as Confluence and the Lecture Series) as well as cultural highlight stories.</p>
								<p>Sidekicks are present on all other pages, and should contain imagery representative of the page's content.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						
						<div>
							<img alt="Features" class="alpha grid_3" src="../assets/img/guide/wf-features.png">
							<div class="grid_6 omega">
								<h4>Features Bar</h4>
								<p>This design also incorporates a <em>features bar</em> on the homepage for high quality content from the community. These can include original videos, community profiles, or important articles.</p>
								<p>Featured content are meant to provide lasting value, and therefore do not flow temporally with the news. More general news, like what is frequently on the site as it exists now, is placed in a column below this bar, alongside events and student projects.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						
						<div>
							<img alt="Side Navigation" class="alpha grid_3" src="../assets/img/guide/wf-sidenav.png">
							<div class="grid_6 omega">
								<h4>Side Navigation with Breadcrumbs</h4>
								<p>Primarily a content page convention, <em>side navigation</em> appears to help the user navigate into deeper levels of information. There are states for both second-level and third-level links in this element, and the site architecture must not dive deeper than three levels of hierarchy on any content branch.</p>
								<p>In most cases, the side navigation appears with a <em>breadcrumb trail</em> to help the user navigate back up the content branch. In the Exhibition, breadcrumb trails occur independently of side navigation.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						
						<div>
							<img alt="Bottom Bar" class="alpha grid_3" src="../assets/img/guide/wf-bottom.png">
							<div class="grid_6 omega">
								<h4>Bottom Bar</h4>
								<p>Studies have shown that when a user reaches the end of a page, if there isn't compelling enough information, they'll leave the site entirely. The <em>bottom bar</em> is an element whose primary purpose is to increase user engagement by weaving a consistent story throughout branches of content.</p>
								<p>This element shows a variety of navigation options, for instance, a link to the previous and next news stories. In content pages, it continues to the next page in that content branch. In this way, this element weaves smaller parts of the entire website together and helps encourage the user to learn the entire story of our school.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						
						<div>
							<img alt="Related Content" class="alpha grid_3" src="../assets/img/guide/wf-related.png">
							<div class="grid_6 omega">
								<h4>Related Content</h4>
								<p>On every page, except for the homepage and Exhibition, this bar provides 2&ndash;4 pieces of related content. For example, on a page about applying to the school, it can house quick links for downloading relevant PDF forms.</p>
								<p>When the related content box ends, allow it some vertical clearance before "breaking the grid" into it's vertical column, to help the site read clearly.</p>
