							<p class="content">Last week, News Corp. released <a href="http://www.thedaily.com/">The Daily</a>, a subscription-based iPad-only newspaper. Before its release, The Daily was interesting to people in the world's technology and journalism industries for a few reasons. It was rumored to be the poster child for a long-awaited subscription model in the iOS ecosystem, and it was the first time a major journalistic entity really took the iPad (and tablet form-factor devices) seriously.</p>

							<p class="content">With a new brand would hopefully come fresh, new ideas from what is arguably the biggest news corporation in the world.</p>

							<p class="content">It didn't happen.</p>
							
							<p class="content">The Daily's success has yet to be measured, and while subscription services on iOS devices are here to stay, a few minutes with The Daily starts to show the age of its ideas, and the lack of polish in its execution. It's still just the same stuff in a new wrapper.</p>
							
							<p class="content">Last week, <a href="http://www.pushpoppress.com">Push Pop Press</a> also made news across the technology internet with a simple coming soon page. This new startup will be making books without Adobe's Digital Media Flash platform or other existing magazine of book frameworks. According to <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/02/push_pop_press" rel="Daring Fireball">John Gruber</a>, who talked with the developers and played with some working apps, Push Pop Press will be making native books in the iPad's native Objective-C, but that's nothing new. It seems like these books are very well-designed from a visual standpoint precisely for the iPad's form factor, and also take advantage of the iPad's rich media capabilities. There is no chrome. The design is not skeuomorphic, trying to mimic a book with fake page turns and a textured red ribbon for bookmarks. It is simply well designed, and designed with attention paid to the medium at hand.</p>

							</blockquote>
						
							<p class="content">What Push Pop Press does is going to be very important moving forwardâ€”eBooks were never the right solution to the problem of digital books, but I think this might be.</p>
							
							<p class="content">The problem with eBooks is that the format is designed to be compatible with any device that wants to read them. In that sense, an eBook is like a web site: It looks different on every device at every size. While eReaders like the Kindle and the Nook are growing in popularity, you won't see them replacing brick-and-mortar bookstores anytime soon. When's the last time you read a design book on your Kindle? You probably never have, and chances are you never will. eBook forms are designed for text, not image, and even then, they're barely designed for text so much as for portability and uniformity. When's the last time you read a well-designed book on your Kindle? You haven't, because every book looks the same.</p>
							
							<p class="content">This is fundamentally in opposition to why people love the physical form of a book. We love books because each individual artifact is a unique and original piece of history that we can hold in our hands and touch, and feel, and cherish. We put them on our bookshelves with all of our other books and when our friends come over, we say "Have you read this book?" and we take it out, carefully, and hand it over to them as if we are handing over a piece of ourselves. The feeling of the pages brushing against our fingertips as we flip through them, to the smell of the pages when you open the cover to the first page, how the book was printed, to even the color and texture of the paper. These are all things that no device will ever be able to mimic, no matter how magical or revolutionary they are. However, the grid, the typography, vibrant imagery, rich colors, and even an enticing cover&mdash;all of these are aspects of a book that we can embrace and experience on our iPads and digital devices, provided we put in the hard work to make them happen. eBooks as a format lose all of these things, reducing culturally-rich artifacts to just their guts (not that the content is bad or anything). Push Pop Press was ready and willing to put in that hard work, and that is exciting.</p>
							
							<p class="content">One of the other beautiful parts of a book is the intuitive interaction, etched into our cultural memory from thousands of years of use. We can't mimic that. I don't even think we should try. I'm certain that a good interaction designer can make a wonderful, intuitive interaction unique to a touch-based device, without trying to mimic a book. No one has yet. Everyone, Apple included, tries to use page swipes, textured paper patterns, and fake layered pages to give a skeuomorphic illusion that they are reading a book. There are apps like <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/solar-system-for-ipad/id406795422?mt=8">The Solar System</a> and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-elements-a-visual-exploration/id364147847?mt=8">The Elements</a> that try to make books in tablet formats without following the historical format of a book, and while they are valiant efforts, the interaction in those apps aren't there yet. People look at them and play with the interactive 3D images and watch the embedded movies and are wow-ed, but they are interactive showcases, not books.</p>
							
							<p class="content">Push Pop Press, I think, has a chance to change all of this. It sounds like they just might. The lack of chrome implies an entire 'gestural' vocabulary as interface. No chrome means no title bar, or back button, or bookmark button, or anything like that. There are some obvious setbacks here in terms of interaction and navigation, but that's nothing that some smart interaction design can't solve. The attention to typography and design in general will fare well in creating emotive experiences that people can really get immersed in. </p>
							
							<p class="content">Granted, it's a lot more work to have to design and natively program each individual book, but this might be able to be abstracted into a platform and easily manipulated. Or maybe that's beside the point. Maybe itâ€™s just that these apps themselves are special artifacts, and only releasing two or three every year is a special part about the app. It's "exclusive," or "limited," or "high-end" in that it takes time to prepare.</p>
							
							<p class="content">The most important part of what Push Pop Press seems to be doing is the proof of concept. The print and journalism industry seem to think that they can take the content they already have, throw it all inside of a standard container with bigger buttons for touch targets, and make tons of money because it's a "new platform" that's "revolutionary." Just look at CondÃ© Nast and Adobe. With a new platform must come new, innovative thinking. It's like the Wild West: it's a goldmine, but only for the people that go at the new territory in an intelligent way, not the existing giants who lazily try to monopolize it. It could be that those giants are going about it intelligently, but that hasn't been the case so far, and there are sales numbers to prove it.</p>
							
							<p class="content">The real significance here is that Push Pop Press, with their high-profile staff and interesting new idea, is going to set a standard from the industry. If they do this right, Apple will notice, because Apple notices good design. It will get featured in the App Store and put on display iPad devices in Apple Stores, possibly around the world. Then, consumers will notice, and say "Hey, this is what we want," and then the larger media conglomerates will have no choice but to listen.</p>
