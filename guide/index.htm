						<h2 class="inside">Overview</h2>
						<p class="content">Over the past five months, we have done extensive research, iterated many concepts and developed a direction for the School of Designâ€™s web presence. We believe that embracing the modern web is one of the best things that the School can do as a brand today, and we hope that this interaction prototype makes this as clear to you as it is to us.</p>
						
						<p class="content">In the initial phase of the studio, roughly the first half of the semester, we did extensive research around the online presences of various educational and design-centric institutions. Moving forward, our goal was to create something unique to any of the websites that we came across in our research so as to re-establish the School of Design as an educator and innovator in the industry.</p>
						
						<p class="content">We believe that this School has many unique characteristics that cannot be duplicated by our much larger competitors, such as RISD or MICA. We've created a website that caters to our unique needs as an institution, playing to these natural advantages while keeping in mind a lot of the considerations that arose in both in-class discussions as well as faculty meetings, as we've heard them.</p>
